### System Design
### guidelines
Good guideline resoure - [link](https://youtu.be/i7twT3x5yv8?si=hc-jdz8dB3_7vYR-)
1. Clarify: Why are we building the system? Who are the users? What features do we need to build?
2. Focus on the top few features to build and agree on the priority order
3. Clarify non-functional requirements (probably most relevant are scale and performance but there are also: security, consistency, accuracy and more)
4. Flow: API Design --> High level design diagram (retain a list of discussion points for later and avoid diving too deep ((db scaling, high concurrency, failure scenarios))) --> Deep dive (point out points of failure and figure out with the interviewer what to discuss about) --> Wrap up (summarize the design

#### concepts
1. "A service is scalable if it results in increased performance in a manner proportional to resources added"
2. Static HTML caching example - Craiglist - pros: low cost because disk space is relatively cheap, performance because db only "spits" up bits (static pages) and cons: every change is costly (need to configure ALL static pages)
